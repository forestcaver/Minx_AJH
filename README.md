v1.1 normals the first input jack to ground (if you have v1.0 boards - it's trivial to just jumper the jack !)

BOM spreadsheet is untested - I havent built from this BOM ! Pls check carefully if you use it.

Please note - pcbs and panels are being sold by other people - I have no connection, financial or otherwise, to anyone selling pcbs and panels, hence I feel no commercial obligation to offer build support! I am just freely offering up these designs! Enjoy!
